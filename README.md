# Houdini HDAs

## These are just some random HDA's that I have made avaiable to the public. 

1. To add these to your houdini copy the hda into the otls folder. 
2. If youre on windows the otls folder should be in your /documents/houdini19.5/otls.
3. If you do not have this folder you can just create it and add the hda inside.
