# Houdini HDAs

## These are just some random HDA's that I have made avaiable to the public. 

To add these to your houdini copy the hda into the otls folder. 
If youre on windows the otls folder should be in your /documents/houdini19.5/otls.
If you do not have this folder you can just create it and add the hda inside.
